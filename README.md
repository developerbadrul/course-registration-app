## Features

- Component-Based Architecture: React is known for its component-based approach, which allows developers to create reusable UI components. This promotes a modular and efficient way to build user interfaces.
- Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual representation of the DOM (Document Object Model) to optimize rendering performance. Instead of directly manipulating the actual DOM, React compares the virtual DOM with the real DOM and updates only the necessary parts, minimizing browser reflows and improving efficiency.
- Declarative Syntax: React employs a declarative approach to building user interfaces. Developers describe what the UI should look like for a given state, and React automatically manages the underlying DOM updates. This makes it easier to reason about the UI's behavior and maintain the codebase.


## Project Discuss
- Local State vs. Global State: React allows you to manage state locally within a component or globally across the entire application. Local state is suitable for component-specific data, while global state management tools like Redux or the Context API are used for sharing data across different parts of the app.

- Passing State: State can be passed down from parent components to child components as props. This allows child components to access and display the data.
